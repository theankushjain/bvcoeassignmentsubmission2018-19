GraphQL has been used to store the node details in the database, the mutations to createchildnode and creategenesisnode has been done along with create user

The relationships between users and nodes and between two nodes is also there.

The UI is not good because of the time and there are no encryptions as well.

There are two types of nodes. One is genesis node and other is simple node.
Genesis node doesn't have a parent node.
Every simple node has a parent node as well as a genesis node.
The user can add a node along with its parent.
The child nodes of any node can also be seen by the user.
